# Hazir App 
Hazir App was built for Habib University student body to help them track their attendance amidst severe attandace policies by the management.

Interesting, we built this behind the back of the management and reverse engineered the app to get the attendance data. We found a vulnerability in the attandance system and exploited it to get the attendance data.
